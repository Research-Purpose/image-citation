The relevant part of the code is the nested \"additionalProperties\" object, which is defined twice in the schema. This duplication is likely causing the error mentioned in the question.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo resolve the issue, you can remove the inner \"additionalProperties\" object, as it is not necessary and is causing the duplication error. The corrected code would be:\n\n*   \"additionalProperties\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"nullable\": true\n}\n\nBy removing the inner \"additionalProperties\" object, you ensure that the schema only defines additional properties once, resolving the error.",

The x-ticks are set to range from 0 to 24, while the y-ticks are set to range from 0 to 31. However, the issue mentioned in the question is that not all y-ticks are showing, and the x-ticks are not ordered correctly.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo fix the issue, you can modify the code to set the x-ticks to range from 1 to 24, and ensure that all y-ticks are displayed by adjusting the y-axis limits. Here is an updated version of the code:\n\n```python\nax.set_xticks(range(1, 25))\nax.set_xticklabels(str(number) for number in range(1, 25))\n\nax.set_yticks(range(0,32))\nax.set_yticklabels(str(number) for number in range(0, 32))\n```\n\nAdditionally, you can use the `ax.set_ylim()` function to adjust the y-axis limits and ensure that all y-ticks are visible. For example:\n\n```python\nax.set_ylim(0, 32)\n```\n\nBy making these changes, you should be able to resolve the issues mentioned in the question and display the polar chart with the correct x-ticks and y-ticks.",
